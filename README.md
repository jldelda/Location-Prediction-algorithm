This Repository is not finished. This is just the data preparation part. Feel free to clone it and keep working with your data to create a better algorithm.

## Methodology

I have created a grid of 1,200 squares meters to identify every cell of the city and give them different characteristics. The grid has exactly 2651 cells that overlay the city of Rio de Janeiro.

The following image helps you to undertand the concept.
